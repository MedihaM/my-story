            When I was in grade 4, our class had a yearbook.

            We were allowed to fill in our own sections.

            Yup, that was me - Mediha Munim. I was too cool to smile back then (how times have changed!).
            <br><br>
            I loved to create things - artwork, crafts, origami and more - but I loved to create things <i>from junk</i> even more. The concept of taking random objects and giving them value was fun, challenging, and felt productive. 
            <br><br>
            I continued to produce artwork for years, evolving my creativity and improving the quality of my work. However, I didn't know what I wanted to pursue in life. I no longer wanted to become an artist or an author.

            My first experience coding was in grade 11. I enrolled in a computer science course at my high school. Slowly, I began to understand the ingenuity of computer programming - the art of <i>Creating from Nothing</i>. I could literally create an infinite amount of things with just my laptop. I was hooked. My first programming language was <a href="https://www.processing.org">Processing</a>, and I created a small action game with a partner for the class.

            I graduated high school. It was summer, and I had accepted my offer to study Life Science at McMaster University because I still didn't know what I wanted to do for a living. Since I had some time on my hands, I thought I would have some fun programming again. I spent over 100 hours creating a one-minute long RPG game from scratch, again in Processing. This time, I made the (somewhat lacking) art assets. The terrible humour was mine as well.

            I knew I needed to switch programs. Since I had a passion for creating things, I looked into engineering. Since I had enjoyed working on my game over the summer, I officially made the switch.
        </p>
        
        <h1> 2017</h1>
        <p>
            I studied very hard this year. During my second year at McMaster, I independently and collaboratively created a vast range of programs. I created my first websites using HTML and CSS, learned to code in Java and Python, grew familiar with Linux, LaTeX, Git and understood what it means to be a software engineer. A few of my projects, including <a href="https://github.com/2XB3GreenLight/ProjectFiles">Green Light</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MedihaM/Battleship"> Battleship</a>, can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/MedihaM">GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h1> 2018 </h1>
        
        <p>
            During third year, I worked with two groups to create fully-functional programs.
            <br><br>
            The first was called <a href="https://github.com/MedihaM/ReTouch">ReTouch</a> - an implementation of the existing software <a href="https://www.kde.org/applications/education/ktouch/">KTouch</a> in Java. I was the lead programmer and implemented the main functionality of the program.
            <br><br>
            The second project was called uVibe, an Android application that connects to a user's Spotify account and provides an emotional analysis of their songs. I was the team leader and made significant contributions to the application's documentation and front-end development.
